# Simple Machine Language (SML)
# Objective is to practice with subclasses, modifying existing code, and the use of reflection.
# 1. Create a subclass of Instruction for each kind of SML instruction.
# 2. Add code to the method Translator.instruction to translate that instruction.
# 3. Now take the switch statement that decides which type of instruction is created, modify the code so that it uses Java reflection to #create the instances.
